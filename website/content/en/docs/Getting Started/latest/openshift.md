    Additional configuration for OpenShift

## Release 0.8.0 is not compatible with jenkins image shipped by redhat in OpenShift.

But probably it will run correctly with the jenkins lts version. If you find any issue please report it here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator/issues/826.
