# Jenkins Operator Roadmap

This document outlines the vision and technical roadmap for [jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator) project.

## Project Vision

With Jenkins Operator project we want to enable our community to run Jenkins in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes, OpenShift and others. Also, support most of the public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) in terms of additional capabilities like backups, observability and cloud security.  


With declarative configuration and full lifecycle management based on [Operator Framework](https://operatorframework.io/) this can become the de facto standard for running Jenkins on top of Kubernetes.


Now, we have a dedicated team which can bring more engineering effort to the project.

## Technical Roadmap

- Upgrade Operator SDK [#494](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator/issues/494)
    - https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/tag/v1.3.0
